      <ol>
                  
    <li> <b> Beat the eggs:</b> In a bowl, beat the eggs with a pinch of salt and pepper until
   they are well mixed. You can add a tablespoon of water or milk for a fluffier texture.

   <li> <b>  Heat the pan:</b> Place a non-stick frying pan over medium heat and add butter or oil.
             
  <li> <b> the omelette:</b> Once the butter is melted and bubbling, pour in the eggs.
    Tilt the pan to ensure the eggs evenly coat the surface.
                
    <li> <b> Add fillings (optional):</b> When the eggs begin to set at the edges but are still slightly
    runny in the middle, sprinkle your chosen fillings over one half of the omelette.
                
    <li> <b> Fold and serve: </b> the omelette continues to cook, carefully lift
     one edge and fold it over the fillings. Let it cook for another minute, then slide it onto a plate.
                   
     <li> <b>Enjoy :</b> Serve hot, with additional salt and pepper if needed.
